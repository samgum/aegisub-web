# subedit: client-side subtitle editor (status)

> **Status (2026-07-14): shipped.** Phases 0-6 are all done. subedit is public at
> [github:hikashop-nicolas/subedit](https://github.com/hikashop-nicolas/subedit) (MIT),
> lives at [hikashop-nicolas.github.io/subedit](https://hikashop-nicolas.github.io/subedit/),
> and is wired into Omnitext as a git dependency. What remains is optional polish
> (see the end of the Phases list) rather than core work.

## Goal

A standalone, framework-agnostic, browser-only subtitle editor library, same
pattern as pdfedit / sheetedit / geoedit / mediaplay:

- Public repo `github:hikashop-nicolas/subedit`, MIT (name checked free on npm
  and GitHub on 2026-07-12).
- Consumed by Omnitext as a git dependency for opening .srt / .ass / .ssa / .vtt (DONE).
- Uses **mediaplay** as a dependency for the video/audio preview pane, which
  brings for free: MKV/legacy container remux, AC-3/E-AC-3/DTS/TrueHD audio
  decode, styled ASS rendering via libass with embedded fonts.
- Everything runs locally; the video never leaves the machine (including
  speech recognition, see ASR section).

## UI layout (modeled on Subtitle Edit's main window)

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Toolbar: open video | +cue | -cue | shift times | fix overlaps.. |
+--------------------------------------+---------------------------+
| Cue list (virtualized)               | Video preview             |
| # | start | end | dur | CPS | text   | (mediaplay embed, or a    |
|   ...                                |  "Load video/audio" button|
|--------------------------------------|  when none is loaded)     |
| Selected-cue detail editor:          |                           |
| start/end/duration fields + textarea |                           |
+--------------------------------------+---------------------------+
| Waveform / timeline (canvas): cue blocks, playhead, zoom, scrub  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

- Cue list: virtualized rows (must handle 5000+ cues), columns #, start, end,
  duration, CPS, text preview. Click selects, double-click seeks the video.
  CPS and line-length cells colored when over threshold.
- Detail editor below the list: precise start/end/duration inputs and the text
  area for the selected cue. ASS override tags ({\i1} etc.) are shown raw in
  v1, like Aegisub, no WYSIWYG tag editing.
- Video preview: an embedded mediaplay player. The video is session-local: it
  is picked by the user, never persisted with the document (too big). The last
  video filename can be stored in the subtitle doc's session metadata so we can
  prompt "reload GITS_01.mkv?".
- Waveform strip at the bottom: rendered peaks, cue blocks positioned on the
  timeline, draggable edges (retime), draggable body (shift), click to seek,
  wheel to zoom, playhead follows playback.

## Keyboard model (editor-first)

Space play/pause, arrows seek, [ and ] set selected cue start/end at the
playhead, Enter inserts a cue at the playhead, standard list navigation.
mediaplay's own capture-phase shortcuts must NOT swallow the editor's keys:
the embed needs a mediaplay option to disable or scope its global keydown
handler (upstream change, see below).

## Formats and preservation

Cue model: `{ startMs, endMs, text, styleRef?, layer?, actor?, effect?, raw? }`.

- **SRT** and **VTT**: full parse + serialize. Simple formats, regenerating is
  fine, but preserve BOM, line-ending flavor, and VTT header/NOTE/STYLE blocks.
- **ASS/SSA**: in-place philosophy like the other libs. Only touched Dialogue
  lines are rewritten; [Script Info], [V4+ Styles], [Fonts], [Graphics],
  comments and section order stay byte-identical. Field order follows the
  file's own Format: line. Style names surface as a dropdown per cue.
- Golden round-trip fixtures from day one: parse then serialize an unedited
  file and assert byte-identical output (SRT/VTT modulo none, ASS strictly).
- mediaplay's existing srtToVtt/assToVtt converters are one-way display
  helpers; subedit owns its own round-trip parsers.

## Video preview: mediaplay integration

Upstream additions needed in mediaplay (small, keeps subedit thin):

1. `handle.getMediaElement(): HTMLMediaElement | undefined`, the escape hatch
   giving subedit currentTime, seek, play/pause, timeupdate, captureStream.
2. `handle.setSubtitleText(content: string, filename: string)`: programmatic
   external-subtitle load (same path as the existing "load external subtitle"
   button). subedit feeds the serialized in-progress document, debounced
   (~300ms), so the preview always shows the edited subtitles, with full libass
   styling when the doc is ASS.
3. `opts.embedded?: boolean`: disables mediaplay's document-level capture-phase
   shortcuts and hides the external-subtitle button (subedit owns both).

Sync behaviors: double-click cue seeks; timeupdate highlights the current row
(auto-scroll optional toggle); playhead drawn on the waveform.

## Waveform

- PCM source: `AudioContext.decodeAudioData` for plain audio files; for
  containers (MKV/MP4) use mediabunny's AudioBufferSink through the mediaplay
  dependency; Dolby/DTS tracks can reuse mediaplay's decoder path in a later
  pass (not v1-blocking, the waveform is a nice-to-have per track type).
- Downsample progressively to min/max peak pairs per bucket, render into
  cached canvas tiles per zoom level; extraction runs chunked so the UI stays
  responsive, waveform fills in left to right.
- Interactions: drag cue edges (snap to other cues optional), drag cue body,
  double-click empty area to insert a cue, click to seek.

## Phase 4: ASR / automatic transcription

Decision (2026-07-13): **Whisper via transformers.js is the v1 and only engine.**
Web Speech is dropped, even as a fallback: it is real-time only (25 min video =
25 min), Chrome-only, phrase-level timing, and spotty on-device language coverage.
Whisper gives word-level timestamps (the thing that makes auto-segmentation good),
faster-than-real-time inference on WebGPU, ~99-language multilingual support with
auto-detection, and runs fully locally. The `TranscribeBackend` interface stays so
another engine could be added later, but we build only the Whisper backend.

### Model delivery: download-on-demand, never bundled

No model ships in the subedit bundle. transformers.js fetches the weights from the
Hugging Face CDN on first use and caches them in the browser (Cache Storage /
IndexedDB); every later run is offline. This keeps the shipped binary tiny while
allowing best-quality models.

- **Multilingual models only** (not the `.en` variants) so all ~99 Whisper
  languages work with auto-detection. Use the Xenova/onnx-community ONNX builds
  that transformers.js consumes (quantized for browser size).
- **Model-size selector**, remembered per user, each downloaded on demand when
  first chosen:
  - tiny ~40 MB (fastest, roughest)
  - base ~75 MB (DEFAULT, good balance)
  - small ~150 MB (best quality, slower)
- **Privacy**: the only network call is the one-time model download from the HF
  CDN; audio never leaves the device. Surface this in the UI ("downloads the model
  once, then works offline, your audio is never uploaded"). Optional future: a
  self-hosted-weights toggle for zero third-party contact.
- **CSP note**: on subedit's own GitHub Pages site the fetch is unrestricted; a
  strict-CSP host embedding subedit (Omnitext) must allowlist the HF origin.

### Interface (pluggable, but only Whisper implements it)

```ts
interface TranscribeBackend {
  available(): Promise<boolean>;                 // WebGPU/WASM support probe
  listModels(): { id: string; label: string; sizeMb: number }[];
  transcribe(
    audio: Float32Array,                         // 16 kHz mono, extracted once up front
    opts: { model: string; language?: string },  // language omitted = auto-detect
    onSegment: (seg: { startMs: number; endMs: number; text: string; words?: WordTs[] }) => void,
    onProgress: (p: { stage: "download" | "transcribe"; ratio: number }) => void,
  ): { cancel(): void };
}
```

### Inference details

- Run transformers.js in a **Web Worker** so the UI (and the waveform/preview)
  stays responsive; post progress + segments back to the main thread.
- **Backend**: prefer WebGPU (`device: "webgpu"`, fp16), fall back to WASM (quantized
  int8) when WebGPU is unavailable. Report which is in use, and warn that WASM is
  much slower.
- **Audio**: decode the media to a 16 kHz mono `Float32Array` once (reuse
  mediaplay's decode path / extractWaveformPeaks plumbing, which already handles
  MKV/Dolby/DTS and streams large files), then chunk into ~30 s windows for
  Whisper with a small overlap; use `return_timestamps: "word"` for word-level
  timing, `chunk_length_s`/`stride_length_s` for the long-form pipeline.
- Emit segments incrementally so cues appear live as chunks finish.

### Segmentation module (engine-agnostic, the quality lever)

Separate, unit-tested `segmentToCues(words, opts)` that turns Whisper's word
timestamps into readable cues, independent of the engine:

- break on sentence-ending punctuation and on speech gaps over a threshold;
- cap each cue at ~2 lines, ~42 chars/line, and a max CPS (reading speed); split
  over-long spans at the nearest word boundary / punctuation;
- snap cue start/end to the enclosing word timestamps; enforce a min duration and
  a small inter-cue gap;
- balance a 2-line cue's break near the middle at a word boundary.

This is where subtitle quality lives; keep it pure and covered by golden tests.

### UI / flow

- **Entry points** (one "Auto-transcribe" action):
  a) new empty doc: the empty-state panel offers "Load a video, then generate
     subtitles"; b) existing doc: a toolbar button that appends, or replaces after
     a confirm.
- **Dialog**: model-size picker (with download size + cached state shown), language
  = Auto by default with an override list, Start/Cancel.
- **Progress**: two-phase bar (model download %, then transcription %), the WebGPU/
  WASM badge, live partial cues streaming into the list, and a working Cancel that
  aborts the worker.
- Resulting cues land in the normal editor for correction; format defaults to SRT
  for a fresh doc (convertible as usual).

### New files / touch points

- `src/transcribe/backend.ts` (interface + registry), `src/transcribe/whisper.ts`
  (worker glue + model management), `src/transcribe/whisper.worker.ts` (transformers.js),
  `src/transcribe/segment.ts` (+ `segment.test.ts`), `src/transcribe/ui.ts` (dialog);
  editor.ts wires the toolbar button, empty-state action, and cue insertion, reusing
  `loadPreviewMedia` and the audio-decode path.
- transformers.js is a lazy dynamic import (kept out of the base bundle); the worker
  and its WASM/WebGPU assets load only when transcription starts.

### Spikes to de-risk early

1. transformers.js Whisper in a Worker on GitHub Pages: model fetch + cache, WebGPU
   path, `return_timestamps: "word"` shape, and cancellation.
2. Decode-to-16kHz-mono from the existing mediaplay path for arbitrary containers.
3. Segmentation quality on a couple of real clips (tune thresholds against goldens).

## Media-anchored multi-track workflow (direction, 2026-07-13)

Reframe: subedit is not only a single-file subtitle editor but a **project anchored
to a media file** that holds several subtitle tracks. Motivating end-to-end case: open
a fansub MKV (Japanese audio + an embedded English ASS sub track), generate a French
track from the English one, and save a new MKV that keeps everything and adds the FR
track. This unifies ASR, translation, and mux into one flow.

### Data model

- `Track = { id; label; language; doc: SubtitleDoc; origin: "opened" | "embedded" |
  "transcribed" | "translated" }`. Each track is an independent, editable/re-timeable
  `SubtitleDoc` (the existing editor model), so languages that need different
  segmentation stay free.
- The editor holds a `tracks: Track[]` + `activeTrackId`. Opening a single `.srt`/`.ass`
  still yields a one-track project (byte-faithful as today). Opening a video yields a
  multi-track project read from the container.
- A generated track (MT/ASR) clones the source track's cue timing and fills text; after
  that it is a normal independent track.

### Open flows

- Subtitle file: one track, unchanged.
- Video (MKV first, the fansub norm): read the container with mediaplay's
  `extractMkvInfo(bytes)` — it already returns `subtitles: [{ label, language, vtt,
  assDoc? }]`, `audio: [...]`, and embedded `fonts`. Load each subtitle track (parse the
  reconstructed `assDoc` for ASS, else the vtt) as a Track; wire the audio for
  playback/waveform (existing path). MP4 text tracks: later.

### Track switcher UI

A tab/dropdown strip (EN | FR | JA | + generate) to switch the active track; switching
re-points the cue list / detail / timeline / preview at that track's doc. Add-track menu:
"Transcribe from audio…", "Translate this track…", "New empty track".

### Generators (each makes a new track)

- **Transcribe (ASR)** from the audio — Phase 4, done. Produces a source-language track.
- **Translate (MT)** from an existing track — text→text, m2m100 (~500 MB, 100 langs) or
  NLLB-200 (~800 MB, 200 langs), user-selectable; a second lazily-loaded worker mirroring
  the Whisper one. Direct (src→tgt) when the source language is known, else pivot via
  English. Reuses `wrapLines` to re-wrap translated text; timing carried from the source
  track. (Model list + language-code maps already stubbed in transcribe/backend.ts.)

### Save / export

- Per-track: export any track as its own file (byte-faithful for opened tracks).
- **Mux into the container** (the headline): mediabunny stream-copies video + audio and
  writes ALL subtitle tracks — the originals (re-packed from their `assDoc`, so styling
  survives) plus generated tracks. Streams to disk via showSaveFilePicker + StreamTarget
  for multi-GB files. See the mux section for the required mediabunny ASS extension.

### Build order

1. Multi-track model + track switcher (refactor the editor to hold tracks; open-file stays
   one track).
2. Open-video → load embedded sub tracks + audio (extractMkvInfo).
3. Translate-track-to-track (the MT subsystem, largely started).
4. Mux-save with the mediabunny S_TEXT/ASS extension (see below).

### Risks

- The editor currently assumes a single doc; introducing tracks touches the list/detail/
  timeline/preview wiring and the public API (getText → per-track). Keep single-file open
  behaving exactly as now.
- Large files (GITS ~1.7 GB, E-AC-3): demux + mux must stream, never buffer whole.
- `extractMkvInfo`'s `assDoc` is a faithful reconstruction, not the original bytes, so an
  embedded track's round-trip is content-faithful, not byte-faithful (acceptable).

## Mux subtitles into the video file (export)

"Save into video": remux the loaded video with the edited subtitles as
embedded (soft) tracks. Always writes a NEW file (containers cannot be spliced
in place, and it protects the source); output goes through
showSaveFilePicker + StreamTarget so multi-GB files never sit in memory.

- Engine: mediabunny (already present via mediaplay). Input from BlobSource,
  video/audio tracks stream-copied packet-by-packet (no re-encode, disk-speed),
  subtitle track added, existing subtitle track optionally replaced or kept.
  Track metadata UI: language, track name, default/forced flags.
- Container support (verified on mediabunny 1.50.8): MKV, WebM and MP4 accept
  subtitle tracks, WebVTT codec only; MOV accepts none. So:
  - SRT/VTT docs: converted to WebVTT and muxed, effectively lossless.
  - ASS docs into MKV: REQUIRED (user priority). WebVTT would strip all styling
    while MKV natively supports S_TEXT/ASS, and mediabunny cannot stream-copy an
    existing ASS track either, so preserving embedded ASS tracks also depends on
    this. Extend mediabunny's Matroska muxer, which is a BOUNDED fork (its muxer
    already writes CodecID + CodecPrivate + subtitle blocks generically):
    1. add `'ass' -> 'S_TEXT/ASS'` (and `'utf8' -> 'S_TEXT/UTF8'` for SRT) to
       `CODEC_STRING_MAP` + the `SubtitleCodec` union;
    2. add an ASS `SubtitleSource` that sets CodecPrivate = the ASS header (Script
       Info + [V4+ Styles] + the [Events] Format line) and packs each cue into the
       Matroska payload "ReadOrder,Layer,Style,Name,MarginL,MarginR,MarginV,Effect,
       Text" with block timestamp = start, BlockDuration = end - start.
    This mirrors mediaplay's existing S_TEXT/ASS *reader*. Ship as a fork
    (github:hikashop-nicolas/mediabunny, matching the mediaplay pattern) consumed
    directly by subedit, and PR upstream. Embedded fonts from `extractMkvInfo`
    can be re-attached so styled tracks render with their intended fonts.
  - MP4 output soft subs: mediabunny's isobmff muxer already maps webvtt -> the
    'wvtt' sample entry, but v1.50.8 ASSERTS during finalize when a WebVTT
    subtitle track is present (video-only MP4 and MKV+webvtt both work). This is
    a bug in an intended path, so the SAME fork fixes it. Policy: MP4 output
    carries PLAIN-TEXT soft subs only (wvtt/tx3g) - MP4 cannot hold styled ASS -
    so a styled ASS track saved to MP4 loses styling; steer styled tracks to MKV.
  - Container / styling policy: MKV = full styled ASS (via the S_TEXT/ASS fork);
    MP4 = plain-text soft subs (after the assert fix). Source container without
    subtitle support (or MOV/AVI): offer "save as MKV" instead (stream-copy +
    container swap).
  - The fork (github:hikashop-nicolas/mediabunny, PR upstream later) thus has TWO
    subtitle-write jobs: (1) Matroska S_TEXT/ASS + S_TEXT/UTF8; (2) fix the isobmff
    WebVTT-into-MP4 finalize assert.
- Round-trip check: reopen the produced file in the preview (mediaplay already
  extracts embedded tracks) as a built-in verification step.
- Hard-burn (rendering subtitles into the picture, re-encode) is OUT of scope;
  it belongs with the transcode machinery in mediaplay's legacy-formats plan.

## Omnitext integration

- Formats .srt / .vtt / .ass / .ssa get a subedit editor module
  (src/editors/subtitle.impl.ts, thin adapter like media.impl.ts, locale
  synced via setLocale). CodeMirror remains available as the alternate raw
  text editor through the existing editor switcher; subedit is the preferred
  editor.
- These are TEXT formats: Omnitext's normal text pipeline (autosave, recovery,
  history) applies, unlike the read-only media viewer. getBytes() serializes
  the current doc; onChange marks dirty.
- New-file flow: rather than modifying Omnitext's new-file form to host a
  video drop area, "New subtitle file" simply opens an empty doc in subedit,
  whose empty state IS the video + auto-generate panel. Same result, zero
  Omnitext-core surgery, and the standalone demo gets the identical flow.
  (If we later want it in the form itself, the form can grow a per-format
  extension slot, deferred.)
- Assets: octopus + libav copies already handled for mediaplay; no new assets
  unless/until the Whisper backend lands (model is fetched at runtime, not
  bundled).

## QA / utility tools (toolbar)

v1: shift all times (offset +/-), fix overlaps, CPS + line-length warnings,
find & replace. Later: change framerate, merge/split cues, remove HI text,
translate mode (two-column original/translation).

## Phases

- **Phase 0, scaffold + formats [DONE]**: repo from the geoedit template (tsc to
  dist/, prepare on git install, demo/, Pages deploy.yml, test.yml). SRT + VTT
  parsers/serializers with golden fixtures, cue model, virtualized cue list,
  detail editor, toolbar shell, i18n en/fr/ja. Usable as a video-less editor.
- **Phase 1, preview [DONE]**: mediaplay upstream API (getMediaElement,
  setSubtitleText, embedded option) shipped in mediaplay; embed + load-video
  button, double-click-cue seek, current-cue highlight on timeupdate, live
  subtitle re-push on edit (300ms debounced), space/arrows keyboard model.
  handle.loadPreviewMedia(file) added for programmatic loading (ASR flow).
- **Phase 2, waveform [DONE]**: bottom canvas timeline (src/waveform.ts) with cue
  blocks, time ruler and playhead; click to seek, wheel to zoom (deltaY) / pan
  (deltaX / shift), drag a cue body to move or its edges to retime. Waveform peaks
  come from mediaplay's extractWaveformPeaks (streamed decode, every playable codec
  incl. E-AC-3/DTS, no file-size cap), shown with an "extracting" progress label
  and aborted when another file loads.
- **Phase 3, ASS [DONE]**: src/ass.ts byte-preserving parse/serialize (Script
  Info / styles / [Fonts] kept verbatim; Dialogue AND Comment lines parsed as cues
  and rebuilt from fields via the section Format order, so an unedited canonical
  line round-trips identically). Format switcher gained ASS with srt/vtt<->ass
  conversion. Live preview renders styled ASS via libass (mediaplay). Extended ASS
  editing shipped: full styles editor (create/edit/dup/delete, all common fields,
  font datalist), per-cue Style picker + Edit button, per-cue actor/effect/layer/
  margins + Comment(disable) toggle, inline B/I/U/colour, position picker (\pos via
  clicking the preview), fade (\fad), karaoke (\k) editor, script-properties panel.
  Word-based alignment labels. Also shipped: transform popover (\frz/\fscx/\fscy/
  \fsp/\blur) with animate (\t); position picker click=\pos / drag=\move; timeline
  block visuals (fade triangles + karaoke syllable marks); rectangular clip
  (\clip/\iclip drag-a-rectangle + inverse); vector drawing tool (\p, click points
  to build a polygon); actor column; effect dropdown with per-effect params; margins
  group (vertical hidden for middle alignment); alignment "no alignment". FUTURE
  (not built): decoding embedded [Fonts] to real font names, complex 7-arg \fade,
  editing an existing drawing's points, bezier (b) drawing commands.
- **Phase 4, ASR**: DONE. Whisper (transformers.js in a Worker, WebGPU/WASM,
  multilingual auto-detect, download-on-demand + cache, model-size selector +
  guidance, translate-to-English task); engine-agnostic segmentToCues; toolbar
  generate dialog. Becomes a "generate a track" action under multi-track.
- **Phase 5, media-anchored multi-track** DONE (the core): track model +
  switcher; open video -> load embedded sub tracks (MKV + progressive/fragmented
  MP4) + audio; transcribe (Whisper) and translate (m2m100/NLLB) into new tracks;
  mux-save: styled ASS-in-MKV + WebVTT-in-MP4, saving back into the source
  container, streamed to disk. Uses the mediabunny fork
  github:hikashop-nicolas/mediabunny#subedit-s_text-ass (pinned), which adds
  S_TEXT/ASS to the Matroska muxer AND fixes the ISOBMFF subtitle finalize
  assert. Save streams via StreamTarget + showSaveFilePicker (blob-download
  fallback). Remaining refinement: translation generation tuning (m2m100 over-
  generates on very short inputs).
- **Phase 6, Omnitext** DONE (2026-07-14): published subedit to GitHub
  (hikashop-nicolas/subedit, public, Pages) and wired it into Omnitext:
  editors/subtitle.ts + subtitle.impl.ts adapter, srt/vtt/ass/ssa format
  descriptors (nativeEditor "subtitle", CodeMirror text fallback), removed
  Omnitext's plain-text "subtitle" placeholder, bumped Omnitext's mediaplay
  to the commit exporting decodeAudioToMono16k/extractWaveformPeaks. subedit
  dist now rewrites new URL("./x.worker.ts") -> .js so a consumer bundler
  (Vite) can resolve the transcription workers. Shipped to Pages + APK.
  Post-integration hardening (all shipped): new *blank* .srt/.ass docs open
  straight in the subedit cue editor in Omnitext (opt-in format flag +
  MIME-derived filename so a blank .ass opens in ASS mode); mediaplay's libav
  loader retries past a poisoned dynamic import (one transient failure had
  silently killed AC-3/E-AC-3 audio, waveform and Dolby transcription for the
  whole page session); and the transcribe/translate buttons now toast on a
  failed dialog import instead of silently doing nothing. The standalone demo
  header was cleaned up (styled Open + New-with-format buttons).
- **Post-1.0 editor tools** DONE (2026-07-14): undo/redo (snapshot history, coalesced by
  a 500ms window); video-timing workflow (set start/end at the playhead, play-from-cue,
  follow-playback auto-scroll); editing power tools (merge/split cues, find-replace bar,
  problems panel for overlaps / too-fast / over-long with click-to-jump); and more formats
  (MicroDVD `.sub`, LRC, TTML/DFXP parse+serialize+detect+convert, SRT/VTT/ASS/MicroDVD
  round-trip faithfully, LRC/TTML regenerate their lossy parts).
- **Later / out of scope for now**: Web Speech / cloud ASR backends (MP4 subtitle
  extraction, progressive + fragmented, tx3g/wvtt, is DONE via codem-isoboxer),
  image-based subtitles (VobSub/PGS need OCR), hard-burn subtitles, WYSIWYG ASS tag editing.

## Risks

- Whisper model download is 40-150 MB on first use; mitigate with an explicit
  size picker, cached-state indicator, download progress, and a base default.
- WebGPU is not everywhere; the WASM fallback works but is much slower. Detect,
  report which backend is active, and warn on WASM for long media.
- transformers.js is heavy; keep it a lazy dynamic import + Worker so the base
  bundle and the editor stay light.
- mediaplay embed keyboard conflicts: solved by the embedded option, but the
  two projects now version-lock (subedit pins mediaplay like Omnitext pins its
  libs; verify fixes in the consumer's node_modules dist).
- ASS files in the wild are messy (mixed encodings, duplicate sections);
  parser must be lenient on read, conservative on write.

## Verification and CI (2026-07-29)

Before this, every format test parsed a string written a few lines above the assertion,
so the suite could only show subedit agreeing with itself: a file no other player
understands passed all 121 of them. And `editor.ts`, the largest file here, had no test
of any kind, because everything it does it does to the DOM.

What runs now, in three CI jobs:

- **test** — the unit suite plus the corpus tests (read, preserve, write).
- **oracles** — rebuilds and re-validates the corpus against ffmpeg and pysubs2, then
  checks what subedit *writes*: 13 of the 18 formats read back by an independent reader,
  the XML formats through xmllint, and the muxed MKV/MP4 through ffprobe.
- **e2e** — 16 Cypress specs driving the real editor in Chrome.

**The corpus is never authored by subedit.** ffmpeg writes the fixtures it has a muxer
for; the rest are written from the format's definition and then have to be recovered
correctly by an independent reader before being accepted as ground truth. Five formats
(SBV, Spruce, QuickTime Text, DVD Studio Pro, TTXT) have no such reader and are marked in
`test-corpus/manifest.json` as golden files rather than left looking verified.

**Which reader is authoritative was measured, not assumed**, and the disqualifying
findings are recorded in `scripts/oracles.mjs`: ffmpeg's WebVTT muxer does not escape
`<` or `&`, its SAMI reader does not decode them, pysubs2's WebVTT reader does not
either, and ffmpeg's Spruce reader treats the frame field as hundredths of a second
whatever the file declares.

### Defects it found, all fixed

- WebVTT character references counted as literal text, so `&amp;` read as five characters
  in the reading-speed figure and converting to any other format carried the escaping
  through as visible text. Converting *into* WebVTT then left a bare `>`, which a stricter
  ffmpeg than the local build refused; escaping is now decided by scanning, since the same
  `<` is markup in `<i>` and a literal in `5 < 4`.
- SBV put the file's trailing newline inside the last cue.
- TTXT wrote a line break as `&#10;` and had no numeric-reference decoding, so saving a
  multi-line cue twice turned the break into a literal `&#10;` mid-line.
- SubViewer trimmed the blank line after `[SUBTITLE]`, adding one back on save to every
  file that did not have one.
- Converting to a frame-based format wrote no frame rate, leaving every time in the file
  dependent on the reader guessing the same default.
- Muxing into an ordinary MP4 threw `Timestamps must be non-negative` and wrote nothing,
  because an AAC track starts one frame before zero (encoder priming). Most .mp4 files
  with sound have it, so this was not an edge case.

### Left open, deliberately

- **`S_TEXT/WEBVTT` in Matroska.** mediabunny writes that codec ID; libavformat knows only
  the `D_WEBVTT/*` family, so ffmpeg cannot identify or extract the track, and a track
  ffmpeg cannot identify is one many players cannot show. Changing it means changing the
  mediabunny fork, which is a call about interop against the current registry rather than
  a bug fix. subedit's own styled path (ASS in MKV) is unaffected and reads perfectly.
- **WebVTT in MP4** is checked structurally only. mediabunny writes a conformant `wvtt`
  sample entry with its `vttC` config, and ffmpeg has simply never demuxed it (no
  occurrence of `wvtt` in libavformat), so there is no reader here to confirm the payload.
- **A file whose timestamps are all negative** would want shifting rather than dropping
  pre-roll. Raw transport-stream captures can look like that; nothing subedit opens has.
- **Five formats have no independent reader at all.** Finding or writing one for SBV,
  Spruce, QuickTime Text, DVD Studio Pro or TTXT would close the last real gap.
