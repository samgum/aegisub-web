// Do the containers subedit writes actually hold the subtitle tracks it thinks they do?
//
// "Save into the video" has the most to lose here: it writes a media container, and until now
// the only thing that ever read one back was subedit itself, by searching the bytes for ASCII
// markers. That shows the strings are somewhere in the file. It does not show the container is
// well-formed, that the tracks are declared, or that the cues survived.
//
// ffmpeg is used for the tracks it can read, and only those. Two it cannot, and the difference
// between "ffmpeg will not read this" and "this file is broken" is the whole point of the
// exercise, so it is written down rather than assumed either way:
//
//   - WebVTT in MP4 (ISO/IEC 14496-30, a `wvtt` sample entry). libavformat contains no
//     occurrence of "wvtt" at all: ffmpeg has never demuxed it, and reports the track as
//     `data`. mediabunny's output carries the wvtt entry and its vttC config box, so the file
//     looks right; ffmpeg is simply not a reader for it. Checked structurally below.
//   - WebVTT in Matroska. mediabunny writes the codec ID `S_TEXT/WEBVTT`; libavformat knows
//     only the `D_WEBVTT/*` family, so ffmpeg reports no codec for the track and cannot
//     extract it. Also checked structurally, and worth knowing about: whatever the registry
//     says, a track ffmpeg cannot identify is one a great many players cannot show.
//
// The ASS-in-MKV track, which is the one subedit's fork of mediabunny exists to produce, ffmpeg
// reads perfectly, so that one is compared cue by cue against the ground truth.
//
// Run after `vitest run src/corpus/mux-corpus.test.ts`.
// Usage: node scripts/check-mux.mjs
