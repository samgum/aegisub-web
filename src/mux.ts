 * hardware encoder produce, so most .mp4 files with sound have it. mediabunny refuses a
 * negative timestamp outright, which meant saving subtitles back into an ordinary video threw
 * "Timestamps must be non-negative" and wrote nothing at all.
 *
 * Dropping a packet that ends at or before zero reproduces exactly what the source presents,
 * and cannot discard anything audible, because a player was already told not to play it. A
 * packet straddling zero is kept and clipped, so no real content is lost either way.
 *
 * Not handled: a file whose timestamps are ALL negative, which would want shifting rather than
 * dropping. Raw transport-stream captures can look like that; nothing subedit opens has.
