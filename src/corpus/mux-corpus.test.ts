// Mux subtitle tracks into a real container, for scripts/check-mux.mjs to inspect.
//
// "Save into the video" is the feature with the most to lose and the least cover: it writes a
// media container, and the only thing that has ever read one back is subedit itself, by
// searching the bytes for ASCII markers. That shows the strings are in there. It does not show
// the container is well-formed, that a player would find the track, or that the cues survived.
//
// So this writes real files and scripts/check-mux.mjs hands them to ffprobe and ffmpeg.
