// This is the half the suite could not reach on its own. Everything else here proves subedit
// reads back what it wrote, which stays true even if what it wrote is a file no other tool
// understands. Writing the files from a vitest run is the only practical way to drive subedit's
// TypeScript from a plain node script, and it is the same split richdoc and sheetedit use.
//
// The route taken is the one a person takes: open a file, choose a different format from the
// toolbar, save. So this covers the conversion path too, not just the serializers.
